Intersection:
It
was
a
dark
and
stormy
night
the
rain
in
at
it
by
of
up
is
that
along

Union:
fell
torrents-except
occasional
intervals
when
checked
violent
gust
wind
which
swept
streets
for
London
our
scene
lies
rattling
housetops
fiercely
agitating
scanty
flame
lamps
struggled
against
darkness
It
was
a
dark
and
stormy
night
Everyone
at
the
wing-ding
They
weren't
type
So
they
went
up
on
train
bridge
Where
weather
howling
And
oh
my
When
that
comes
rolling
by
No
paper
thin
walls
no
folks
above
one
else
can
hear
The
crazy
cries
of
love
were
laughing
dancing
in
rain
knew
their
strong
heard
far
off
whistle
hoping
it
going
to
be
long
Cuz
In
back
booth
an
all
cafe
Two
dripping
raincoats
are
hanging
Outside
shade
streetlight
is
clanging
smile
ear
eye
Ice
cream
melting
piece
pie
Oh
Every
kiss
sweet
touch
totally
tandem
As
come
a-rumbling
along
sang
lover's
song
wild
abandon
