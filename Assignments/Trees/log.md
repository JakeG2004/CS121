9:30 - Started Program Design
10:00 - Finished Program Design & started STRee.h
10:13 AM - Finished first version of BSTree.h
10:48 PM - Finished first version of BSTree.cpp
11:16 PM - Wrote test code. It seems to work. I'm gonna call it a night here. About 2 hours in so far and I got all of the tree logic working YIPEEEE!! I also need to update the functions so they don't have to refer to their own head in the function call. It's kind of nasty rn.
11:30 PM - Updated deleteTree() to actually free all of the memory that was being used.

11:30 AM - Started working on the actual project code
1:06 PM - I got most of it working, but the actors don't seem to want to work very well. It's really odd. I also should decouple a lot of my functions from the data structure
1:13 PM - It doesn't work well because there is whitespace around a lot of the names. I need to make something that removes whitespace from the end of a string

10:00 PM - Started working on whitespace removal and duplicate removal
10:30 PM - Done! I think the assignment is finished.

9:00 AM - Added function overloads to the implementation file so that the showDB.cpp code is prettier.
