9:30 - Started Program Design
10:00 - Finished Program Design & started STRee.h
10:13 AM - Finished first version of BSTree.h
10:48 PM - Finished first version of BSTree.cpp
11:16 PM - Wrote test code. It seems to work. I'm gonna call it a night here. About 2 hours in so far and I got all of the tree logic working YIPEEEE!! I also need to update the functions so they don't have to refer to their own head in the function call. It's kind of nasty rn.
11:30 PM - Updated deleteTree() to actually free all of the memory that was being used.
