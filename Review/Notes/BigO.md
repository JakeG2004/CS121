# Big-Oh(O(N))
## What is Big Oh?
Big oh notation is a mathematical contation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

In other words, it measures, in general, how long a function will take to run. (Time complexity)

In big-oh notation, we count 

## A few examples:
### Sorting algorithms
- Bubblesort: $N^2$
- Selection sort: $N^2$
- Mergesort: $N(log(N))$
- Quicksort: $N(log(N))$ best and average case, and $N^2$ Worst case

### Arrays
- Unsorted array: $N$
- Sorted array: $log(N)$, if using binary search, $N$ otherwise.

### Trees
- Binary search tree: $log(N)$
- AVL tree: #log(N)$
- Red-Black Tree: #log(N)$
