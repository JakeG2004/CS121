# Program Log <br> Jake Gendreau

## Hours:
Started 6:15 PM Feb 26 <br>
6:52 - header file and implementation file finished <br>

FEB 27 2:45 PM: <br>
Im just gonna restart with a clean slate and try to implement it myself rather than following the provided program description <br>
4:15 it all works now. Valgrind detects no leaks and I haven't had it crash. Now i get to make it pretty. <br>
4:57 beautification done. I think ill call it a day here. <br>
6:23 PM Feb 28 <br>
The program only works with characters at the moment, which is great if every number is 0-9, but I need to make it work with strings instead <br>
9:07 with a bit of struggle later, and mis-use of a new stack, it works with strings. Yippe!!<br>

## struggles:
pop keeps throwing errors for me
turns out it was not pop. It's peek. I learned that through GDB. Handy piece of software that one is

## what did i learn:
valgrind and gdb <br>
