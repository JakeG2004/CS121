# Assignment 2: Linked Lists and Sets <br> Jake Gendreau <br> February 8, 2024 <br> Program Log

## Time Requirements

* This program took me about 2 hours and 15 minutes to implement. 
* Getting the first data set to work only took an hour and a half, except the program didn't work with the second data set, so I had to do some more thinking.

## Things I encountered while making this program

* Reading files was a little confusing at first, but I got the hang of it.
* I initially had it reading off line by line, rather than word by word. This worked fine in the first data set, but got me in the second data set.
* Parsing the second data set for duplicates seemed really daunting at first, until I realized that it would be pretty easy to just check for duplicates as I make the linked lists.
* My debugger didn't work so I spent a while trying to fix that. I didn't fix it.
* I made it take command line args so that I could change the data set without having to recompile.
* I feel like I may have written too many comments, but too many is better than too few.
* GitHub is a lifesaver. Almost lost a whole bunch of work, but version control had my back.

## Things I encountered making the program design
* LaTeX is really confusing, but fortunately, markdown supports all of the same math expressions, so I have been using that instead.
* Additionally, GitHub uses markdown for the readme.md files, so it's good that I learned it.
* I do better when I make the program design and the actual program at the same time. Actually doing it helps me figure out errors and improvements that could be made.
