# Classes
A class is a user-made datatype that can contain data fields and methods.

A data field is a data type, like `int` or a `string`.

A method is a class function like `class.Function()`

## Example class

    class myClass
    {
        int x = 0;
        string data = "Wow!";

        void myClass()
        {
            cout << "New class!" << endl;
        }
    };

This class has a field, `x` which is an int, a second field, `data` which is a string, and a member `myClass()`, which is a constructor.

A pointer to a class object may or may not be defined.
